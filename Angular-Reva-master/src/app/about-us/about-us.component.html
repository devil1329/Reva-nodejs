                                <p class="description">Reason to create this website is to
                                        tell people about the importance of anime. I love to watch anime
                                        and most of the time either I watch anime or play video games.
                                        Everyone around me looks at me in a disgust way that I belong to
                                        a different world. It disgust me more as people compare these
                                        animes with cartoons. Are they out of their mind to compare this
                                        art to that shit, but it is what it is.</p>
                                <p class="description">Ay my initial stage, I found it
                                        difficult to find good animes but it
                                        was not easy and I watch very bad onees too. From there I get
                                        the idea to create a website which provide a guide to interested
                                        ones to watch good content only, which they would love and also
                                        help them to develop.</p>
